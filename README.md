# Conway's Game of Life in the browser with React

This is in super heavy development, but I'm having a blast!

## Development setup

```shell
# install dependancies
npm install
```

## Run tests

```shell
# run tests one time
npm run test

# auto run the tests on file changes
npm run twatch
```

## Build for the browser

```shell
# build `public/index.js one time`
npm run build

# auto build on file changes
npm run watch
```
